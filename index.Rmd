mrgsolve is an `R` package for simulation from hierarchical, ordinary 
differential equation (ODE) based models typically employed in drug development.

<br>

## mrgsolve is free, open-source software
mrgsolve is distributed as a package for `R` and utilizes an ODE-solver from 
`ODEPACK` which is freely-available in the public domain.  We develop mrgsolve 
on [github](http://www.github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve), with input and 
contributions from the pharmacometrics modeling and simulation community.  We 
welcome feature requests and bug reports on the GitHub site [issue
tracker](http://www.github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues).

## Links and Resources
* [Benchmarks](http://github.com/mrgsolve/nmtests#readme): We simulate data for 
  certain scenarios from both NONMEM and mrgsolve and compare the outputs. 
  All the code needed to run or confirm the outputs is included in the git 
  repository. mrgsolve does not match NONMEM in every way; but there is 
  substantial overlap so that a wide variety of models estimated in NONMEM
  can be simulated in mrgsolve.

## An example

The following is a simple example to illustrate the basics of how mrgsolve 
works.  You can find more examples and usage vignettes in the links above or in 
the "Help Topics" menu in the nav bar at the top of the
[mrgsolve.github.io](https://mrgsolve.github.io) main page.



```{r,message=FALSE}
library(mrgsolve)
```


First, a model object is created.  As an introduction, we will use a pre-coded model 
from an internal library.
```{r,message=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
mod <- mread("irm1", modlib())
```

An overview about this model
```{r,comment='.'}
mod
```

Next, let's create an intervention for the model.  We do this with an event object.
```{r}
e <- ev(amt=100, ii=24, addl=3)
```

Now, we simulate with our model object (`mod`) and the event object (`e`)
```{r,comment='.'}
out <- mod %>% ev(e) %>% mrgsim(end=240,delta=0.1)
out
```

And plot
```{r,"plot_1"}
plot(out)  
```


The source code for this model:
```{c,eval=FALSE, comment=" ",  code=mrgsolve:::code(mod)}

```
